      `Resumes should concisely showcase relevant skills, experience, and accomplishments, tailored to the specific job being applied for. 
      They must be well-organized, easy to read, and free of errors, with a clear structure that highlights key qualifications.

      and using keywords from the posting can increase the chances of passing through automated screening systems.

      emphasizing their suitability for the role.`

      `The interview process starts with candidates submitting their applications, followed by an initial screening to filter out unqualified applicants. 
      Selected candidates undergo a preliminary interview, often via phone or video call, to assess their basic qualifications and fit. 
      Those who pass proceed to in-depth interviews with hiring managers and team members, 
      which include technical, behavioral, and situational questions. Some roles may require assessments or tasks. 
      The process typically ends with reference checks, a final interview, and, if successful, a job offer. 
      Communication throughout the process is crucial to keep candidates informed about their status.`
